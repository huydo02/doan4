    <h2>Medical tourism refers to people travelling to a country other than their own to obtain medical treatment. In the past, this usually referred to those who traveled from less developed countries to major medical centers and highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home. However, in recent years, it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to third-world countries for lower-priced medical treatments. The motivation may be for medical services unavailable or illegal in the home country.</h2>
